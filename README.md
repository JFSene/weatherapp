<h1 id="veepee-weather-app">Veepee Weather App</h1>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Veepee Weather App is a simple and elegant weather forecasting application built using SwiftUI. It provides users with current and future weather conditions for a selected city. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly manner.</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Displays current weather conditions for a city.</li>
<li>Provides detailed weather forecasts, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and hourly forecasts.</li>
<li>Allows navigation to detailed forecast views for specific days.</li>
<li>Includes error handling for network issues and displays alerts to users when errors occur.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="special-instructions">Special Instructions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ensure you have an active internet connection to fetch weather data.</li>
<li>Replace the placeholder API key with your own key from OpenWeatherMap if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="architectural-choices">Architectural Choices</h4>
<h5 id="swiftui-for-user-interface">SwiftUI for User Interface</h5>
<ul>
<li>The app uses SwiftUI for building its user interface, leveraging its declarative syntax to create responsive and dynamic views. SwiftUI&#39;s powerful data binding system ensures that the user interface stays in sync with the underlying data models.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="combine-for-reactive-programming">Combine for Reactive Programming</h5>
<ul>
<li>Combine is extensively used throughout the app for handling asynchronous operations and managing state changes. By using Combine, the app can react to new data, handle errors, and update the UI efficiently. The @Published properties in view models ensure that the views update automatically when the data changes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="network-layer">Network Layer</h4>
<p>The app features a robust network layer encapsulated in the NetworkService class. This class is responsible for making API requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, handling responses, and decoding JSON data into model objects. By using Combine&#39;s AnyPublisher, the network layer can seamlessly integrate with the view models, ensuring a reactive flow of data.</p>
<h4 id="view-models">View Models</h4>
<p>The app employs the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, which helps separate concerns and improves testability:</p>
<ul>
<li>HomeViewModel: Manages the state for the HomeView, fetches the weather forecast, filters daily forecasts, and handles errors.</li>
<li>DetailViewModel: Provides detailed weather data for a specific day to the ForecastDetailView.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="custom-views">Custom Views</h4>
<p>Several custom SwiftUI views are implemented to display weather data effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>HomeView: The main view that shows the current weather and a list of daily forecasts.
ForecastDetailView: A detailed view showing weather information for a specific day, including hourly forecasts.</li>
<li>ListItem: A reusable view for displaying a single day&#39;s forecast in the list.</li>
<li>CarouselView: A horizontal scroll view for displaying hourly forecasts.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="how-combine-is-utilized">How Combine is Utilized</h5>
<p>Combine is utilized throughout the app to manage data flow and asynchronous operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetching Data: The NetworkService class uses Combine to perform network requests and handle responses asynchronously.</li>
<li>State Management: View models use @Published properties to manage state, ensuring that the views automatically update when the data changes.</li>
<li>Error Handling: Combine&#39;s sink method is used to handle errors gracefully, updating the view models and triggering UI alerts.</li>
<li>By integrating Combine, the app achieves a clean and reactive architecture, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.</li>
</ul>
